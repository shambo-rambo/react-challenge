        <p>Hello! My name is Simon Hamblin, and I'm a passionate Fullstack Web Developer based in Sydney, Australia. <br /><br />
        I come from a strong academic background with a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education with Honors, followed by a Masters in Education Technology, both from Macquarie University. My journey into the tech world is marked by my recent graduation from the Sydney University Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp in 2024, a transformative experience that solidified my skills in modern web development. <br /><br />
My expertise lies in creating dynamic and responsive websites and web applications. I am proficient in the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, enabling me to build full-fledged, scalable applications from the back end to the front end. My education background, coupled with my technical skills, allows me to approach web development with a unique perspective, focusing on creating user-friendly, accessible, and engaging digital experiences.<br /><br />
Whether it's developing interactive websites, crafting robust web applications, or exploring the latest in web technologies, I am always keen on embracing new challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on projects that are not only technically challenging but also make a meaningful impact.
Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers, clients, and anyone as enthusiastic about technology as I am!
